			<p>Engineer by training, I have spent most of my career in commercial roles including customer success, sales and partnerships. I enjoy bringing my analytical mindset and customer empathy together to help customers understand new technologies and services. I have been fortunate enough to work on developing strategies for new markets and love this challenge. Happiest when working in a team of diverse skillsets and drawing on others' experience.</p>

			<p>I have recently taken some time to focus on rounding out my skillset and meeting a diverse network through <a href="https://www.foundersacademy.io" target="_blank"><span class="foundersacademy">Founders Academy</span></a>'s alt-MBA programme. Enjoying the educational part of the course and excited to start a placement in one of London's most dynamic companies. Ideally looking for something where I can get involved in multiple strategic projects, understand how the company operates and work with amazing leaders.</p>

			<p>Hopefully this website serves as a way for me to remember to write on Medium every now and again and keep some web design ideas flowing. If you have any questions or want to get in touch with me shoot me a message!</p>
